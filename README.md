## How to Use

## Game Flow
- **Game Initialization:**  Follow the prompts to enter the number of players (2-5), player names, whether they are AI, and the card size.
- **Round Progression:** In each round, players take turns playing and drawing cards. Card effects (e.g., "4", "10", "Q") influence the round score and game state.
- **End Conditions:** When a player is unable to play a card or has run out of cards, the system determines win/loss and accumulates scores according to the game rules.
- **Results Display:** At the end of each round, the system displays the scores and final rankings of all players.
